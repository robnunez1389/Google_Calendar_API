# Google_Calendar_API

I made this program to eliminate the tedious job of manually inputting each shift I worked into a calendar for my family to see.
We use a shared Google Calendar so everyone knows when something is scheduled, which made this API perfect for what I was looking to 
do. The imaplib module allowed me to get my emails from a specific label, and from there I used beautifulSoup4, pandas and datetime to clean the data so I could display it. I was able to follow the documentation on using the Google Calendar API and created a successful program.
