# Google_Calendar_API

# I made this program to illuminate the tedious job of manually inputting each shift I worked into a calendar for my family to see.
# We use a shared google calendar so everyone knows when someone has something scheduled and we can plan around it.
# This program displays some of my skills using beautifulSoup4, pandas and a few other modules that come in very handy.
# I learned how to use the .gitignore file to keep my personal info to myself so now I can share alot more of my work.
